<span class="pop">Epic-OSM</span> is an open-source framework for working with OpenStreetMap history data to help researchers and communities understand collaboration within OSM. <a href="about">Learn More</a>.

The project is led by <a target="_blank" href="http://epic.cs.colorado.edu/">Project EPIC at the University of Colorado Boulder</a>.  Project EPIC is supported by a $2.8M grant from the US National Science Foundation. It is a multi-disciplinary research effort to support the information needs by members of the public during times of mass emergency. As researchers, we are committed to careful study of socio-technical transformation and building human-centered computation. In addition to empirical observational study that requires new ways of studying massive “widescale” coordination across the internet, we conduct “action research” and employ “participatory design” oriented approaches. We aim to look beyond today’s state of the art and anticipate future socio-technical change.
